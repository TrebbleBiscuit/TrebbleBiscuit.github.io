<!-- Money Printer
A game where you play as the chairman of the Federal Reserve
and your job is to personally print as much money as possible

STAGES OF THE GAME:
        Stage I
- Hand-print money
- Buy money printers and other such devices with money
    - Interns hand-print money for you
    - Printers obviously print money, have their own upgrades
        Stage II
- Conduct open market operations with printed money 
- Debt monitization
- QE
        Stage III
- Rewrite the mandate: Low employment, stable prices, strong asset markets
- Fed can directly purchase securities from the market

HEADLINE: Republocrats denounce Fed's $15 trillion asset purchase plan as "a paltry sum"
